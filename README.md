# Project Overview

Hi there! Welcome to the Orion Earbuds Interactive Experience. This project combines a sleek X-ray slider and a vertical scrolling animation, showcasing the premium features of Orion Earbuds in a visually engaging and interactive way. Using an exported image sequence from Cinema 4D and the powerful GreenSock (GSAP) library, I’ve created a scroll-driven animation that brings these incredible earbuds to life.

# Features

X-ray Slider/Image Revealer

An innovative slider that allows users to reveal the internal design and advanced technology of the Orion Earbuds.
Smooth and intuitive controls make exploring the features fun and informative.
Fully responsive for various screen sizes and devices.
Vertical Scrolling Animation with GreenSock

A dynamic animation driven by GreenSock’s ScrollTrigger, letting users explore the story of Orion Earbuds as they scroll.
The animation highlights key features like noise cancellation, battery life, and ergonomic design, making it engaging and interactive.
Optimized performance ensures smooth playback, even with a high-quality image sequence.
Seamless Integration of Exported Image Sequence

Leveraged Cinema 4D renders to create a polished visual experience.
Each frame is precisely timed for a seamless scrolling experience.
How It Works
As you scroll, the animation transitions through the image sequence, showcasing the journey of Orion Earbuds from concept to reality.
The X-ray slider allows a deeper dive into the earbuds’ design, revealing their internal components and cutting-edge technology.

Why Orion Earbuds?

Advanced Noise Cancellation for immersive sound.
30-Hour Battery Life to power through your day.
Sleek Design that’s as comfortable as it is stylish.
Seamless Connectivity for an effortless user experience.
